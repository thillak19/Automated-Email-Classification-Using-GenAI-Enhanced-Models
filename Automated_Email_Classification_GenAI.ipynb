        "*   **Which machine learning model performed best for email classification?**\n",
        "    It was not possible to identify a best-performing model among FastText, TF-IDF with Logistic Regression, and Sentence Transformers with Logistic Regression. All models exhibited uniformly poor performance, with metrics often resulting in 0.00 or `nan`, primarily due to the critically small dataset size.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Data Analysis Key Findings\n",
        "*   The initial dataset contained 8 email entries, which were split into 6 samples for training and 2 samples for testing.\n",
        "*   **FastText Model**: The model evaluation resulted in `nan` values for Precision, Recall, and F1-Score. This was attributed to the extremely small test set (only 2 samples, both belonging to the 'Promotions' class), rendering reliable quantitative comparison impossible.\n",
        "*   **TF-IDF with Logistic Regression**: This model achieved 0.00 for precision, recall, and F1-score across all classes. The confusion matrix confirmed that the model failed to correctly classify any of the test samples, indicating an inability to learn meaningful patterns from the severely limited training data.\n",
        "*   **Sentence Transformer-based Logistic Regression**: Similar to the TF-IDF model, this approach also yielded 0.00 for precision, recall, and F1-score across all classes. The two test samples (both 'Promotions') were incorrectly predicted as 'Spam' and 'Support', highlighting a complete failure in classification despite using pre-trained semantic embeddings.\n",
        "*   **Overall Model Performance**: All three evaluated models demonstrated an inability to perform effectively on the dataset. The primary and overriding factor for this universal failure was the critically small dataset size, which prevented models from learning, generalizing, or being meaningfully evaluated.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Insights or Next Steps\n",
        "*   The primary next step is to **acquire a significantly larger and more diverse dataset** to enable meaningful model training, evaluation, and comparative analysis. Without sufficient data, model performance metrics are unreliable, and the selection of an effective classification approach remains unfounded.\n",
        "*   It is crucial to recognize that the effectiveness of even advanced models, such as those leveraging Sentence Transformers, is severely constrained by data scarcity. Robust model evaluation and comparison require adequate data to establish meaningful patterns and test generalization capabilities.\n"
